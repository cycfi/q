Fundamentals section of the Q DSP library provides a brief overview of the basic features of the library, including layering and dependencies, file structure, namespace, function objects as fundamental building blocks, rich data types, and user-defined literals. The Q library comprises of two layers: q_io: Audio and MIDI I/O layer. The q_io layer provides cross-platform audio and MIDI host connectivity straight out of the box. The q_io layer is optional. The q_lib layer is usable without it. q_lib: The core DSP library, q_lib is a no-frills, lightweight, header-only library. The dependencies are determined by the arrows. q_io has very minimal dependencies (portaudio and portmidi) with very loose coupling via thin wrappers that are easy to transplant and port to a host, with or without an operating system, such as an audio plugin or direct to hardware ADC and DAC. q_io is used in the tests and examples, but can be easily replaced by other mechanisms in an application. Plugin libraries for DAWs (digital audio workstations), for example, have their own audio and MIDI I/O mechanisms. q_lib has no dependencies except the standard c++ library. The library is organized with this simplified directory structure: docs (1) example (2) q_io ├─ external (3) ├─ include (4) └─ src (5) q_lib └─ include (6) test (7) 1 Where this documentation resides. 2 Self-contained and easy to understand c++ programs that demonstrate various features of the library. 3 3rd party libraries used by the q_io module. 4 q_io header files. 5 q_io source files. 6 Header-only core q_lib DSP library. 7 A comprehensive set of c++ files for testing the library. Other sub-directories not listed here can be ignored. The q_lib module, header-only core, has this simplified directory structure: q_lib └─ include └─ q ├─ fft (1) ├─ fx (2) ├─ pitch (3) ├─ support (4) ├─ synth (5) └─ utility (6) 1 Fast fourier transform. 2 Various \"effects\" processor building blocks. 3 Pitch detection related facilities. 4 Fundamental support facilities. 5 Various synthesisers. 6 Auxiliary utility functions and classes. Other sub-directories not listed here can be ignored. All entities in the Q library are placed in namespace cycfi::q. Everywhere in this documentation, we will be using a namespace alias to make the code less verbose: namespace q = cycfi::q; Typical audio processors in the Q DSP library work on floating point input samples with the normal -1.0 to 1.0 range. However, values are not limited to sampled signals. For instance, signal envelopes are best represented as decibels that are processed in the logarithmic domain, so dynamic-range processors such as compressors and expanders accept decibel as input and return decibel as output. For example: decibel gain = comp(env); comp is a compressor. The compressor above, however, processes signal envelopes rather than raw samples, in contrast to the typical implementation of DSP compressors. The compressor above accepts an envelope represented by decibel, performs computation in the logarithmic domain, and returns a compressed envelope also represented by decibel. Oscillators, as another example, operate on phase-angle inputs and return output samples: float out = sin(phase++); The Q DSP library has a rich set of such types: float and double Typical sample data type -1.0 to 1.0 (or beyond for some computational headroom). frequency Cycles per second (Hz). duration A time span (seconds, milliseconds, etc.) period The inverse of frequency. phase Fixed point 1.31 format where 31 bits are fractional. phase. represents 0 to 2π phase values suitable for oscillators. decibel Ratio of one value to another on a logarithmic scale (dB). For more information, see Units. The Q DSP library is typeful and typesafe. You can not mismatch values of different types such as frequency and decibel, for example. Such potentially disastrous mistakes can happen if all values are just raw floating point types. There are conversions to and from these data types where it is reasonable to do so. decibel can, for example, be converted to 'float' or 'double' using the as_float or as_double conversion functions. Example: float gain = as_float(12_dB); Relational operations are allowed. For example: if (gain > 3_dB) // 3_dB is a decibel literal (see below) s = lp(s); Arithmetic operations are allowed. For example: auto total_duration = 3_ms + 5_ms; // 3_ms and 5_ms are duration literals Where appropriate, arithmetic with raw types are allowed. For example: auto harmonic = 440_Hz * 4; // 440_Hz is a frequency literal To augment the wealth of value types, the Q DSP library makes abundant use of user-defined literals. We take advantage of C++ type safe user-defined literals, instead of the usual float or double which can be unsafe when values of different units (e.g. frequency vs. duration) are mismatched. The Q DSP library makes abundant use of user-defined literals for units such as time, frequency and volume. For example, we use 24_dB, instead of a unit-less 24 or worse, a non-intuitive, unit-less 15.8 —the gain equivalent of 24_dB. Such constants also make the code very readable, another objective of this library. Q Literals are placed in the namespace q::literals. The namespace is sparse enough to be hoisted into your namespace using using namespace: To use these literals, include the literals.hpp header: #include then use the literals namespace somewhere in a scope where you need it: using namespace q::literals; Here are some example expressions: 82.4069_Hz 440_Hz 1.5_KHz 1.5_kHz 1_kHz 0.5_MHz 3_MHz 10.3_s 1_s 20.5_ms 1_ms 10.5_us 500_us -3.5_dB 10_dB 2_pi 0.5_pi Here’s the list of available literals: // frequency constexpr frequency operator \"\" _Hz(long double val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _Hz(unsigned long long int val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _KHz(long double val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _KHz(unsigned long long int val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _kHz(long double val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _kHz(unsigned long long int val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _MHz(long double val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _MHz(unsigned long long int val); // duration constexpr duration operator \"\" _s(long double val); constexpr duration operator \"\" _s(unsigned long long int val); constexpr duration operator \"\" _ms(long double val); constexpr duration operator \"\" _ms(unsigned long long int val); constexpr duration operator \"\" _us(long double val); constexpr duration operator \"\" _us(unsigned long long int val); // decibel constexpr decibel operator \"\" _dB(unsigned long long int val); constexpr decibel operator \"\" _dB(long double val); // pi constexpr long double operator \"\" _pi(long double val); constexpr long double operator \"\" _pi(unsigned long long int val) In the realm of electronic music, there are processors and synthesizers, whose definitions overlap somewhat and differ primarily in how they handle input and output. The processor receives one or more input samples and generates one or more output samples according to a specific processing algorithm. A synthesizer, on the other hand, generates sound from scratch without using any samples. The C++ function object is the most basic building block. In the Q world, both processors and synthesizers are simply function objects, which can be composed to form more complex functions. A function object can accept zero or more input values and generate zero or more output values. Function objects are instantiated from struct or class declarations in the header files. In this example, we instantiate hypothetical f_x and g_x structs: auto f = f_x{}; auto g = g_x{}; Syntactically, you can use these function objects just like any other function. Here’s an example function call invocation for the single input function object, f instantiated above: float r = f(s); where s is the input value, and f(s) returns a result and stores it in the variable r. Composition by passing the result of f to g, like this: float r = g(f(s)); can be encapsulated using function composition in a class or struct: struct fg_x { float operator()(float s) const { return g(f(s)); } f_x f; g_x g; }; Here, we encapsulate f_x and g_x inside the composed function object struct fg_x. We can then instantiate a function object for fg_x just like we would above. The Q DSP library uses fine-grained and reusable function object structs or classes like this. Such reusable components are composed to form more powerful higher level composites. Here’s the code example in the library for signal conditioning: inline float signal_conditioner::operator()(float s) { // High pass s = _hp(s); (1) // Pre clip s = _clip(s); (2) // Dynamic Smoother s = _sm(s); (3) // Signal envelope auto env = _env(std::abs(s)); (4) // Noise gate auto gate = _gate(env); (5) s *= _gate_env(gate); (6) // Compressor + makeup-gain auto env_db = decibel(env); auto gain = as_float(_comp(env_db)) * _makeup_gain; (7) s = s * gain; _post_env = env * gain; return s; } We’re showing only the operator() for brevity. But take note that the code uses multiple function objects for various processing functions that correspond to these class member variables: private: clip _clip; (2) highpass _hp; (1) dynamic_smoother _sm; (3) fast_envelope_follower _env; (4) float _post_env; compressor _comp; (7) float _makeup_gain; onset_gate _gate; (5) envelope_follower _gate_env; (6) }; The complete code can be found here: signal_conditioner.hpp Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Joel de Guzman.

The full example can be found here: example/delay.cpp. The example loads a pre-recorded wav file and plays it back with processing. The raw audio source will be played in the left channel while the delayed signal will be played in the right channel. Pretty much as straightforward as possible. The audio will be played using the currently selected audio device. The final audio output can be heard below: Your browser does not support the audio tag. // fractional delay (1) q::delay _delay{350_ms, 44100}; // Mix the signal s, and the delayed signal (where s is the incoming sample) (2) auto _y = s + _delay(); // Feed back the result to the delay (2) _delay.push(_y * _feedback); Normally, there will be a processing loop that receives the incoming samples, s. The code above are placed: 1 Before the processing loop. 2 Inside inside the processing loop. Typically, you encapsulate the code inside a class where _delay, _y and _feedback are member variables. 44100 is the desired sampling rate. _feedback is the amount of feedback desired (anything from 0.0 to less than 1.0, e.g. 0.85). 350_ms is the delay duration. Take note of 350_ms. Here, we take advantage of C++ type safe user-defined literals, instead of the usual float or double which can be unsafe when values of different units (e.g. frequency vs. duration) are mismatched. The Q DSP library makes abundant use of user-defined literals for units such as time, frequency and volume. For example, we use 24_dB, instead of a unit-less 24 or worse, a non-intuitive, unit-less 15.8 —the gain equivalent of 24_dB. Such constants also make the code very readable, another objective of this library. Processors such as q::delay are C++ function objects that can be composed to form more complex processors. For example if you want to filter the delayed signal with a low-pass filter with a 1 kHz cutoff frequency, you apply the q::lowpass filter over the result of the delay: q::lowpass _lp{1_kHz, 44100}; then insert the filter where it is needed in the processing loop: // Add the signal s, and the delayed, low-pass filtered signal auto _y = s + _lp(_delay()); Let us move on to a more elaborate example. How about a fully functional, bandwidth limited square wave synthesizer with ADSR envelope that controls an amplifier and a resonant filter and control the note-on and note-off using MIDI? Sounds good? This example is complete and self-contained in one .cpp file, kept as simple as possible to highlight the ease-of-use. The full example can be found here: example/square_synth.cpp. In order to run this example, you will need a MIDI input device connected to your system, preferrably a keyboard. Make sure you have at least one installed. If you do not have a physical MIDI input device, you can install one of the MIDI onscreen keyboards. For example, MidiKeys is a small application for MacOS that presents a MIDI keyboard onscreen. Here’s a short video clip: After building the program, make sure you have a MIDI keyboard connected before starting the application. At startup, the app will present you with a list of available MIDI hardware and will ask you what you want to use. Example: ================================================================================ Available MIDI Devices (ID : \"Name\" inputs/outputs): 0 : \"Quantum 2626\" 1/0 1 : \"Code 61 USB MIDI\" 1/0 2 : \"Code 61 MIDI DIN\" 1/0 3 : \"Code 61 Mackie/HUI\" 1/0 4 : \"Code 61 Editor\" 1/0 5 : \"Quantum 2626\" 0/1 6 : \"Code 61 USB MIDI\" 0/1 7 : \"Code 61 MIDI DIN\" 0/1 8 : \"Code 61 Mackie/HUI\" 0/1 9 : \"Code 61 Editor\" 0/1 ================================================================================ Choose MIDI Device ID: 1 And then a list of audio devices to choose from. Example: ================================================================================ Available Audio Devices (ID : \"Name\" inputs/outputs): 1 : \"MacBook Air Microphone\" 1/0 2 : \"MacBook Air Speakers\" 0/2 3 : \"Quantum 2626\" 26/26 ================================================================================ Choose Audio Device ID: 3 Take note that the demo is a console application. The Q library does not have a GUI, for good reason! We want to keep it as simple as possible. The GUI is taken cared of by other libraries (e.g. Elements). After choosing the MIDI and Audio driver, the synth is playable. The synth is monophonic and responds to velocity only, for simplicity. There are more demo applications in the example directory. After this quick tutorial, feel free to explore. Here’s the actual synthesizer with the processing loop: struct my_square_synth : q::audio_stream { my_square_synth(q::adsr_envelope_gen::config env_cfg, int device_id) : audio_stream(q::audio_device::get(device_id), 0, 2) , env(env_cfg, this->sampling_rate()) , filter(0.5, 0.8) {} void process(out_channels const& out) { auto left = out[0]; auto right = out[1]; for (auto frame : out.frames()) { // Generate the ADSR envelope auto env_ = env() * velocity; // Set the filter frequency filter.cutoff(env_); // Synthesize the square wave auto val = q::square(phase++); // Apply the envelope (amplifier and filter) with soft clip val = clip(filter(val) * env_); // Output right[frame] = left[frame] = val; } } q::phase_iterator phase; // The phase iterator q::adsr_envelope_gen env; // The envelope generator q::reso_filter filter; // The resonant filter q::soft_clip clip; // Soft clip float velocity; // Note-on velocity }; Our synth, a subclass of q::audio_stream, sets up buffers for the input and output audio streams and presents those to our processing loop (the process function above). In this example, we setup an audio stream with the selected device, no inputs and two (stereo) outputs: audio_stream(q::audio_device::get(device_id), 0, 2) Behind the scenes, there’s a lot going on here, actually. But you will notice that emphasis is given to making the library very readable, easy to understand and follow, by breaking down complex tasks into smaller manageable tasks and using function composition at progressively higher levels, while maintaining simplicity and clarity of intent. The synthesizer above is composed of smaller building blocks: fine grained C++ function objects. For example, here’s the square wave oscillator (bandwidth limited using poly_blep). For now, we will skim over details such as the adsr_envelope_gen, phase, and phase_iterator, and this thing called poly_blep. The important point, exemplified here, is that we want to keep our building blocks as simple and minimal as possible. We will cover these in greater detail later. The astute reader may notice that our square_osc class does not even have state! struct square_osc { constexpr float operator()(phase p, phase dt) const { constexpr auto middle = phase::middle(); auto r = p < middle ? 1.0f : -1.0f; // Correct rising discontinuity r += poly_blep(p, dt); // Correct falling discontinuity r -= poly_blep(p + middle, dt); return r; } constexpr float operator()(phase_iterator i) const { return (*this)(i._phase, i._incr); } }; constexpr auto square = square_osc{}; Yeah, that’s the complete oscillator. That’s all there is to it! The modern C++ savvy programmer will immediately notice the use of constexpr, applied judiciously all throughout the library. Such modern C++ facilities allow the compiler to generate extremely efficient code, even those that are generated at compile time. That means, for this example, that one can build an oscillator at compile time if needed, perhaps with constant wavetable results stored in read-only memory. The midi_processor takes care of MIDI events. Your application will have its own MIDI processor that deals with MIDI events that you are interested in. For this simple example, we simply want to process note-on and note-off events. On note-on events, our MIDI processor sets `my_square_synth’s note frequency and velocity and triggers its envelope for attack. On note-off events, our MIDI processor initiates the envelope’s release. struct my_midi_processor : midi::processor { using midi::processor::operator(); my_midi_processor(my_square_synth& synth) : _synth(synth) {} void operator()(midi::note_on msg, std::size_t time) { _key = msg.key(); auto freq = midi::note_frequency(_key); _synth.phase.set(freq, _synth.sampling_rate()); _synth.env.attack(); _synth.velocity = float(msg.velocity()) / 128; } void operator()(midi::note_off msg, std::size_t time) { if (msg.key() == _key) _synth.env.release(); } std::uint8_t _key; my_square_synth& _synth; }; In the main function, we instantiate my_square_synth and my_midi_processor. The synth constructor, in case you haven’t noticed yet, requires an envelope configuration (envelope::config). Here, we provide our configuration. Take note that in this example, the envelope parameters are constant, for the sake of simplicity, but you can definitely have these controllable by the user by writing your own MIDI processor that deals with MIDI control change messages. Again, take note of the abundant use of user-defined literals for units such as duration (e.g. 100_ms) and level (e.g. -12_dB). auto env_cfg = q::envelope::config { 100_ms // attack rate , 1_s // decay rate , -12_dB // sustain level , 5_s // sustain rate , 1_s // release rate }; my_square_synth synth{ env_cfg }; Then, we create my_midi_processor, giving it a reference to my_square_synth. We’ll also need a midi_input_stream that receives the actual incoming MIDI messages from the chosen hardware. q::midi_input_stream stream; my_midi_processor proc{ synth }; Now we’re all set. We start the synth and enter a loop that exits when the user presses ctrl-c (in which case the running flag becomes false). In the loop, we give our MIDI processor a chance to process incoming MIDI events as they arrive from the MIDI stream: synth.start(); while (running) stream.process(proc); synth.stop(); Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Joel de Guzman.

The dynamic range of an audio signal is the difference between its loudest and quietest components. Compression, Expansion, Limiting, and Gating are a few common types of dynamic range processing used in audio DSP. Such processing can enhance sound quality, minimize or eliminate noise, and create creative effects. The dynamic range processors in the Q DSP library are unique in that they do not process audio waveform samples directly. Instead, they operate on the envelope of the audio signal, represented as decibel, perform computations in the logarithmic domain, and return a processed envelope, also represented as decibel. As an example, here’s the processing code for the compressor: decibel compressor::operator()(decibel env) const { if (env <= _threshold) return 0_dB; return _slope * (_threshold - env); } This is a hard knee compressor: a type of compressor in which the compression ratio changes abruptly when the input signal exceeds the threshold level, known as the knee point. Both hard knee and soft knee compressors are supported by the Q DSP library. The code accepts an envelope input, env, in decibels and outputs a compressed envelope also in decibels. Processing is done in the logarithmic domain, where addition of two values is equivalent to multiplying their corresponding linear values, and multiplication of two values is equivalent to raising their corresponding linear values to a power. The envelope follower, which is responsible for generating the input envelope for the compressor, is implemented outside of the compressor class. The objective is separation of concerns and the flexibility to use various envelope followers. Compared to their linear counterparts, performing computations in the logarithmic domain is simpler, more intuitive, and makes the code easier to understand while maintaining the same level of efficiency. The compressor example above and all dynamic range processors in the Q DSP library are essentially envelope processors. They receive envelopes, process envelopes, and return envelopes. Since envelope processors operate on the envelope, perform computations in the logarithmic domain, and return a processed envelope, multiple envelope processors can be cascaded. For instance, you can use a single envelope follower and apply the derived envelope to an expander and then pass the result to a compressor, like in the diagram below: A specific use-case for cascading an expander and a compressor, like in the example above, is when you want to use the expander as a noise gate, with soft, non-abrupt gating, set at a threshold just above the noise floor. Then, setting the threshold of the compressor to a high value to even out the dynamic range. The compressor and expander in this case work on different regions of the full dynamic range. But there are also useful cases where the overlap of dynamic ranges the processors are working on is advantageous. The compressor-limiter is a good example. Likewise, multiple compressors with variable thresholds and ratios are another example. By cascading multiple dynamic range processors, we can design efficient multi-function processors like the compressor-limiter with gate (transfer response graph at the right).","title":"Dynamic","component":"q","version":"v1.5-dev","name":"dynamic","url":"/q/v1.5-dev/reference/dynamic.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Example","hash":"_example","id":2},{"text":"Key Points","hash":"_key_points","id":3},{"text":"Cascading","hash":"_cascading","id":4}]},"9":{"id":9,"text":"This section deals with envelope extraction from signals. In audio DSP, an envelope refers to the time-varying changes of a signal. It essentially represents the \"shape\" of the signal in terms of its moment-to-moment changes. Extracting an envelope from a signal is particularly important because they can be used for a variety of processing tasks, including controlling the perceived loudness of a signal, reducing noise, emphasizing particular elements of the signal, modulating amplitude, frequency, and other sound properties, to name a few. Envelopes are typically, but not always, related to amplitude changes, although it can sometimes be related to other parameters like pitch or frequency, phase, and filter cutoff, to name a few. This section will only cover amplitude envelope extraction. Figure 1. Output behavior of different types of envelope followers. The amplitude envelope can also be used to extract dynamic features from a sound. As an example, onset detection is a method for determining the beginning of each musical note. The most basic onset detection scheme involves analyzing the amplitude envelope and detecting sudden changes in amplitude that coincide with the start of each note. [1] The Q DSP library includes a variety of envelope extractors, ranging from the most basic peak envelope follower to the more precise, but computationally demanding, fast RMS envelope follower. Each has distinct strengths, characteristics, and tradeoffs that can be evaluated based on the application’s specific requirements. Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Joel de Guzman. All rights reserved.

Averaging N samples (the moving average window size) increases the SNR by the square root of N. For example, N=16 improves SNR by 4 (12dB). The filter delay is exactly (N−1)/2. Figure 1.

What makes synthesizers so engaging is the level of control they offer over sound creation. A synthesizer allows a user to shape and mold a sound by adjusting parameters such as waveform shape, frequency, amplitude, and filter settings. This level of control enables users to create expressive and unique sounds that can be used in a variety of contexts, ranging from music production to sound design for film and video games. The advancements in DSP technology have made synthesizers even more powerful and flexible. Users can now create sounds that were previously impossible to achieve with traditional analog synthesizers. The Q DSP library provides some common synthesisers such as sine-wave, square, pulse, triangle and saw-tooth, as well as various generators for sculpting the sound envelopes with controls for attack, decay, hold sustain and release. These are designed as moduler building blocks that are combined to form more complex synthesisers. Oscillator is a concept representation of an oscillator that generates periodic waveforms.

These processors typically operate with floating-point input samples in the typical -1.0 to 1.0 range. However, the values are not restricted to sampled signals. For instance, signal envelopes are best represented as decibels processed in the logarithmic domain. Consequently, dynamic-range processors such as compressors and expanders accept decibel as input and return decibel as output. The Q DSP library is typeful and typesafe, which means that each data type is explicitly defined and enforced. This is crucial because it avoids the potentially catastrophic errors that could result from mismatching values of different types. For example, if all values were just raw floating point types, it would be possible to accidentally mix up the frequency and decibel values. Mistakenly interchanging frequency and decibel values could result in erroneous processing of the audio signal and will lead to undefined results. This document aims to provide comprehensive documentation of the fundamental data types used by the Q DSP library.

During the attack phase of an audio signal, the AR envelope follower attempts to follow the signal but is constrained by the attack duration. A longer attack period gives a softer response, exponentially increasing. When the signal level drops below the peak, the follower gradually releases the peak level with an exponential decay. The AR envelope follower models the behavior of two resistors, one for attack, and one for release, each connected in series with an ideal diode —with no voltage drop—, tied together and connected to a capacitor. During attacks, the capacitor charges through the attack resistor, exponentially increasing. The capacitor discharges through the release resistor as the audio signal falls below the peak charge, causing the output voltage to progressively decay with an exponential curve. Figure 1. AR envelope follower response The plot in Figure 1 depicts the response of the AR envelope follower, which was obtained by picking the guitar’s low-E string and using a 2-milliseconds attack duration and 2-second release duration (envelope: magenta, signal: blue, absolute value of the signal: dark blue). It is worth noting that we use the absolute value of the signal to capture both the positive and negative sides of the waveform, as indicated by the dark blue plot. The AR envelope follower does not perform this operation automatically, allowing you to perform any necessary preprocessing before computing the envelope. This flexibility enables you, for example, to capture only the positive or negative peaks, or perhaps the square of the signal, depending on your application needs.

It is based on the hardware article titled Envelope Follower Combines Fast Response, Low Ripple by Harry Bissell Jr. See Figure 1 below. Basically, the result of the fast envelope follower is the maximum of N peak values taken simultaneously. Each value is the maximum of the current sample and the latest held peak value. Each of the peak values are reset to zero in a round-robin fashion. As a peak value is reset, the other peak values still hold the latest peak value. The highest peak among N peaks is then chosen as the current output. Figure 1. Fast Envelope Detector The plot in Figure 2 below shows the fast envelope follower’s response. As compared to the Peak Envelope Follower and AR Envelope Follower, the fast envelope follower’s superior performance is immediately apparent in the plot. Of course, this comes at the cost of additional computing complexity. Figure 2. Fast envelope follower response The reset cycle time is specified by the hold duration parameter. The number of peak values is specified by the div parameter. The plot was obtained by picking the guitar’s low-E string and using a hold duration of approximately 6 ms and with a div of 2 (envelope: red, signal: blue, absolute value of the signal: dark blue). See below for more information on the hold and div parameters. It is worth noting that we use the absolute value of the signal to capture both the positive and negative sides of the waveform, as indicated by the dark blue plot. The fast envelope follower does not perform this operation automatically, allowing you to perform any necessary preprocessing before computing the envelope. This flexibility enables you, for example, to capture only the positive or negative peaks, or perhaps the square of the signal, depending on your application needs. The output is a jagged, staircase-like envelope that tightly follows the input, including fast attacks and decays. Figure 3 below (envelope: red, signal: blue, absolute value of the signal: dark blue) is a closer view of Figure 2 above: Figure 3. Staircase-Like Output The output is suitable for signal analysis as is. If the signal is to be utilized for modulation, for example as input to a Compressor, further filtering is recommended. Fast Averaging Envelope Follower is one such example. Figure 4 demonstrates in closer detail the transient response of various envelope detectors, demonstrating how the fast envelope follower’s response closely follows the true envelope of the signal compared to the Peak Envelope Follower and AR Envelope Follower, both of which perform poorly on signal decays. Figure 4. Transient Response of Envelope Detectors #include template struct basic_fast_envelope_follower { static_assert(div >= 1, \"div must be >= 1\"); basic_fast_envelope_follower(duration hold, float sps); float operator()(float s); float operator()() const; }; using fast_envelope_follower = basic_fast_envelope_follower; basic_fast_envelope_follower is a template class parameterized by div, which must be >= 1. div specifies the minimum duration required for the hold parameter. The hold duration should be equal to or slightly longer than 1/div multiplied by the period of the lowest frequency of the signal we wish to track. For example, if the lowest frequency we wish to track is 440 Hz, and div = 2, then the hold parameter should be greater than 1.13 ms. fast_envelope_follower is an alias for basic_fast_envelope_follower. In general, this is all you need to use, unless you want finer granularity. The higher the div is, the finer the granularity possible.

When the signal level drops below the peak, the follower gradually releases the peak level with an exponential decay. This allows the follower to accurately capture the dynamic changes in the audio signal while avoiding sudden downward fluctuations. The peak envelope follower models the behavior of an ideal diode —with no voltage drop— connected in series with a resistor and a capacitor connected in parallel. The ideal diode allows the positive peaks of the audio signal to pass through, charging the capacitor to the maximum. When the signal falls below the peak, the capacitor discharges through the resistor, causing the output voltage to gradually decay with an exponential curve, following the release time constant. Figure 1. Peak envelope follower response The plot in Figure 1 depicts the response of the peak envelope follower, which was obtained by picking the guitar’s low-E string and using a 2-second release duration (envelope: orange, signal: blue, absolute value of the signal: dark blue).

The peak envelope follower can track fast attack transients, but cannot track downward slopes faster than the specified release duration. However, reducing the release duration too much can reveal envelope ripples. When the release duration is too fast, the peak envelope follower quickly releases the previous cycle’s peak and begins tracking the peak of the next cycle, causing ripples in the envelope follower’s output, as shown in the image on the right. Such ripples can cause unwanted modulation and can be heard as distortion or noise in the audio signal. Further low-pass filtering can reduce the ripples at the expense of smearing the attack shape. #include struct peak_envelope_follower { peak_envelope_follower(duration release, float sps); float operator()(float s); float operator()() const; peak_envelope_follower& operator=(float y); void release(duration release_, float sps); }; env, a, b Objects of type peak_envelope_follower rel Object of type duration sps Floating point value for samples per second. s Floating point value for the latest input sample. y Floating point value from 0.0 to 1.0.

They introduce repetitions of the original signal, resulting in spacious soundscapes and echoes. The number of repetitions is controlled via feedback. The interval between the initial signal and the repetitions is altered by adjusting the delay time. Longer durations provide echoes, whereas shorter delays produce doubling effects. Filters can shape the repeating signals, influencing their tonal properties. Delays are also essential for modulation effects such as flangers and choruses, which are created by dynamically modulating delay times using low-frequency oscillators (LFOs). basic_delay is a basic class for delays. The actual delay duration parameter is decoupled from, and managed outside the class to allow both single and multi-tapped delays.

The MIDI processor is a user-defined construct that follows a specific C++ concept for receiving and interpreting MIDI messages. The MIDI processor acts as an intermediary between MIDI devices and the application. Its purpose is to receive incoming MIDI messages, analyze their content, and extract relevant information. This may include extracting note data, control change values, program change commands, or any other MIDI message content that is of interest to the user. #include // Concepts namespace cycfi::q::concepts::midi_1_0 { /**...**/ } // API and Implementation namespace cycfi::q::midi_1_0 { /**...**/ } Currently, the Q DSP library supports MIDI 1.0, implemented in namespace midi_1_0. namespace cycfi::q::concepts { namespace midi_1_0 { template concept Processor = requires(T&& proc, q::midi_1_0::message_base const& msg, std::size_t time) { proc(msg, time); }; } } Processor is a concept that represents a MIDI 1.0 processor. It is placed inside namespace midi_1_0 to distinguish it from future MIDI processors. Essentially, the C++ concept states that: Processor has a function call operator that accepts a MIDI 1.0 message and a time stamp. The MIDI 1.0 message, msg, is derived from message_base. The time stamp is represented as a millisecond clock with an undefined arbitrary start time. proc Instance of a type that conforms to Processor. msg Instance of a type that conforms to Message. time A std::size_t time stamp. Expression Semantics Return Type proc(msg, time) Process the MIDI message, msg at time stamp time. void processor is a basic class that conforms to the Processor concept, but does nothing by default. struct processor { void operator()(message_base const& msg, std::size_t time) {} }; This utility class provides the default no-op handling. It is intended to be derived from. Thus, the derived class can overload specific function call operators for messages it is interested with. Example: namespace midi = cycfi::q::midi_1_0; struct my_midi_processor : midi::processor { using midi::processor::operator(); void operator()(midi::note_on msg, std::size_t time); void operator()(midi::note_off msg, std::size_t time); }; In this example, my_midi_processor is interested with, and processes only note_on and note_off messages. The dispatch takes in a raw MIDI 1.0 message (raw_message), a time stamp, and a Processor. It converts the raw MIDI message to a specific MIDI message, and dispatches the message to the processor, along with the time stamp. template requires concepts::Processor void dispatch(raw_message msg, std::size_t time, P&& proc); This function is the basic low-level hook for dispatching raw MIDI messages obtained by an I/O system from MIDI devices.","title":"MIDI Processor","component":"q","version":"v1.5-dev","name":"midi_processor","url":"/q/v1.5-dev/reference/support/midi_processor.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Include","hash":"_include","id":2},{"text":"Namespaces","hash":"_namespaces","id":3},{"text":"Declaration","hash":"_declaration","id":4},{"text":"Expressions","hash":"_expressions","id":5},{"text":"Notation","hash":"_notation","id":6},{"text":"Function Call","hash":"_function_call","id":7},{"text":"processor","hash":"_processor","id":8},{"text":"Dispatch","hash":"_dispatch","id":9}]},"49":{"id":49,"text":"Read Basic Concepts first for prerequisite information. Multi-buffer presents a multi-channel buffer arranged in a non-interleaved format where each channel has its own dedicated buffer, and the samples within each buffer are arranged sequentially in contiguous memory locations. The non-interleaved format is ideal for digital signal processing where it is necessary to perform operations on individual channels separately, often in parallel for maximum efficiency. As an example, the figure below shows the memory layout of a 4-channel non-interleaved format. Figure 1. 4 Channel Non-Interleaved Format A Multi-buffer can be conceptualized as a two-dimensional array. The first dimension in this representation corresponds to the samples (x-dimension), while the second dimension represents the channels (y-dimension). Essentially, you can access each individual sample using the two indices ch and i, where ch is the channel index and i is the sample index. mb[ch][i] Each dimension has a size which can be obtained this way: mb.size() // The number of channels mb[ch].size() // The number of frames per channel That way, you can iterate through the channels and samples this way: for (auto ch = 0; ch != mb.size() ++ch) { for (auto i = 0; i != mb[ch].size() ++i) { auto s = mb[ch][i]; // Do something with the sample `s` } } Alternately, you can iterate through the channels and samples in a channel, using C++ range-based for loop syntax, as follows: for (auto ch : mb.channels) { for (auto i : mb.frames) { auto s = mb[ch][i]; // Do something with the sample `s` } } Take note that this syntax is unorthodox in the way it uses C++ range-based for loop syntax. Instead of accessing the channels and samples directly, mb.channels and mb.frames both return a range of indices (corresponding to 0..N, where N is number of channels, for mb.channels or samples, for mb.frames). The design rationale is to always allow random access to all channels and all samples for each channel. For example, you might want to access both the left and right channels of a stereo (2-channel) multi-buffer and mix them: auto left = mb[0]; auto right = mb[1]; for (auto i : mb.frames) { auto mono = right[i] + left[i]; // Add the left and right channels // Do something with `mono` } mb[ch] returns a view of the channel. It does not copy the whole buffer. This \"view\" is lightweight and can be held and passed by value without worrying about performance. The previous example can extend to an N channel mixer this way: for (auto i : mb.frames) { auto sum = 0.0f; for (auto ch : mb.channels) sum += mb[ch][i]; // Do something with `sum` } If you simply need sequential access to the samples in a channel, you can do it this way: for (auto ch : mb.channels) { for (auto s : mb[ch]) { // Do something with the sample `s` } } #include template class multi_buffer { public: using sample_type = T; using buffer_view = iterator_range; using frames_view = iterator_range; using channels_view = iterator_range; // Unspecified constructor buffer_view operator[](std::size_t channel) const; std::size_t size() const; frames_view frames; channels_view channels; }; multi_buffer is a template class that implements the multi-buffer. The template paratemeter, T, is the sample type which is a model of the std::floating_point concept. iterator_range is a template class that holds two random access iterators. It is a model of IndexableContainer, and RandomAccessIteratable. The template parameter, I, is the iterator type. index_iterator is a model of the std::random_access_iterator concept.

It is often used in digital signal processing to smooth a signal (smoothing discontinuities at the edges of sampled signals) or to reduce spectral leakage. The Blackman window has a wider main lobe and lower level side lobes than other windows. It is named after Robert Blackman, who first described it in 1958. The formula for the Blackman window is: w(n) = 0.42 - 0.5 * cos(2pi*n/(N-1)) + 0.08 * cos(4pi*n/(N-1)) Aside from its common use as a window function, the Q DSP library also utilizes the blackman window generator for modulating the audio signal and generating complex envelopes. #include struct blackman_gen { blackman_gen(duration width, float sps); float operator()(); void config(duration width, float sps; void reset(); void midpoint(); }; blackman_gen is a model of Generator.

Each segment is a Ramp that can be configured to have any conceivable shape. A few ramp shapes, including exponential, linear, blackman, and hann are provided. The user may add their own Ramp generator following a well defined c++ concept specification. The plot above is an example of a 5-segment envelope_gen output. The ramp segments S1 to S5 are as follows: blackman_upward_ramp_gen (see blackman_gen) hold_line_gen (see linear_gen) blackman_downward_ramp_gen (see blackman_gen) lin_downward_ramp_gen (see linear_gen) exp_downward_ramp_gen (see exponential_gen) The phases and transitions of the envelope gen are depicted in the following stylized state diagram. There are four phases of interest: Idle phase: The output sits at zero while waiting for the next attack signal Ⓐ. Attack phase: Initiated when the attack signal Ⓐ is received, e.g. when a key is pressed. Intermediate phase: Starts after the attack phase and ends before the release phase. Release phase: Initiated when the release signal Ⓡ is received, e.g when the key is released. The envelope_gen waits for an attack signal Ⓐ while in the idle phase. As soon as an attack signal Ⓐ is received, the state immediately transitions to the attack phase. The output ramps up from 0.0 to the specified attack level, over the specified attack duration. The envelope gen is not retriggerable. Attack signals Ⓐ are only permitted during the idle phase. Any attack signal Ⓐ received outside of the idle phase is disregarded. Use one envelope_gen instance per note. This is most natural with polyphonic voicing, but can also apply to monophonic voicing. For monophonic voicing, on an incoming attack signal Ⓐ, active instances are sent release signals Ⓡ, a new instance is created, and its attack phase is initiated. The output will then be the maximum of all active instances. After the attack phase, anything that comes in between the attack phase and release phase are intermmediate phases that are sequenced by the envelope_gen, one after the other. Intermmediate phases may include the decay phase, the hold phase and the sustain phase. For each intermediate phase, the output ramps up or down from the previous level to the phase’s level over the phase’s duration. Upon receiving the release signal Ⓡ, the envelope_gen immediately transitions to the release phase. This may occur at any point during the attack or intermediate phases. The current phase may be cut short when this happens, and without delay, the output ramps down to 0.0 over the specified release duration. Typically, the last intermediate segment is configured with a very long duration (e.g. for sustain), and normally a release signal Ⓡ will occur long before the last intermediate segment ends. If that is not the case, like for example if the sustain segment is a relatively short linear down ramp, it is possible to transition to the release phase before a release signal Ⓡ is received. After completion of the release phase, the envelope_gen returns back to the idle state. Each envelope segment has parameters for width (the duration of the segment), level (the end level of the segment), and of course the Ramp type. A make_envelope_segment free function, templated on the ramp type, is provided for making segments. #include struct envelope_segment { envelope_segment(envelope_segment const&); envelope_segment& operator=(envelope_segment const&); void level(float level); void config(duration width, float sps); void config(float level, duration width, float sps); /*** Unspecified member functions ***/ }; template inline envelope_segment make_envelope_segment(duration width, float level, float sps); s, a, b Objects of type envelope_segment. w Object of type duration. l Floating point value representing level (0.0 to 1.0). sps Floating point value representing samples per second. T Ramp type. Expression Semantics envelope_segment(s) Copy construct from s. a = b Assign b to a. Expression Semantics Return Type make_envelope_segment( w, l, sps) Make an envelope segment with specified Ramp type, T, level, l, width, w, and samples per second, sps. envelope_segment // Make a 10 ms exponential segment with a peak level of 1.0. auto s = make_envelope_segment(10_ms, 1.0f, sps); Expression Semantics s.level(l) Set the segment level to l. s.config(w, sps) Set the segment width, w, with samples per second, sps. s.config(l, w, sps) Set the segment level, l, width, w, with samples per second, sps. The envelope generator is basically a container (std::vector) of envelope segments. Multiple segments with distinct shape characteristics may be used to construct ADSR envelopes, AD envelopes, etc. #include struct envelope_gen : std::vector { using base_type = std::vector; template envelope_gen(T&& ...arg); void attack(); void release(); float operator()(); void reset(); float current() const; bool in_idle_phase() const; bool in_attack_phase() const; bool in_release_phase() const; std::size_t index() const; }; As a subclass of std::vector, you can use all the facilities of std::vector to compose a multi-segment envelope generator of varying complexity. Take note of the single forwarding constructor that accepts variable arguments. Its purpose is to reset envelope_gen automatically after construction. All arguments are forwarded to the base class. envelope_gen is a subclass of std::vector and inherits all the publicly accessible member functions, member variables, and types of its base class. In addition to valid expressions for std::vector, envelope_gen allows these expressions. g Object of type envelope_gen. Expression Semantics Return Type g() Generate the next value. float Expression Semantics g.attack() Start the attack phase. g.release() Start the release phase. g.reset() Reset and move to the idle phase. Call envelope_gen::reset() whenever the segments change, such as when adding or removing segments from the segments container, to reset envelope_gen to the idle state. Expression Semantics Return Type g.current() Get the current level. float g.in_idle_phase() Return true if we are in the idle phase. bool g.in_attack_phase() Return true if we are in the attack phase. bool g.in_release_phase() Return true if we are in the release phase. bool g.index() Get the current index — the index of the latest active segment. std::size_t adsr_envelope_gen is a subclass of envelope_gen that offers specializations for generating envelopes of the ADSR type. This is a basic subclass that serves as a practical and prototypical envelope generator example. We will provide the full source code below, as an example of how to write an envelope generator. #include struct adsr_envelope_gen : envelope_gen { struct config { // Default settings duration attack_rate = 30_ms; duration decay_rate = 70_ms; decibel sustain_level = -6_dB; duration sustain_rate = 50_s; duration release_rate = 100_ms; }; adsr_envelope_gen(config const& config, float sps); void attack_rate(duration rate, float sps); void decay_rate(duration rate, float sps); void sustain_level(decibel level); void sustain_rate(duration rate, float sps); void release_rate(duration rate, float sps); }; inline adsr_envelope_gen::adsr_envelope_gen(config const& config_, float sps) : envelope_gen{ make_envelope_segment( config_.attack_rate, 1.0f, sps) // Attack (1) , make_envelope_segment( config_.decay_rate, lin_float(config_.sustain_level), sps) // Decay (2) , make_envelope_segment( config_.sustain_rate, 0.0f, sps) // Sustain (3) , make_envelope_segment( config_.release_rate, 0.0f, sps) // Release (4) } { } The config struct contains the constructor specifications for the ADSR paramneters, including attack_rate, decay_rate, sustain_level, sustain_rate, and release_rate. The user may specify these parameters like in this example: // Configure the adsr_envelope_gen auto env_cfg = q::adsr_envelope_gen::config { 300_ms // attack rate , 1_s // decay rate , -12_dB // sustain level , 5_s // sustain rate , 1_s // release rate }; // Instantiate an adsr_envelope_gen auto env_gen = q::adsr_envelope_gen{env_cfg, sps}; These parameters are used to construct the 4 segments comprising an ADSR envelope generator. Each of the segments are created using make_envelope_segment, passing in the Ramp type and the level, width, and samples per second. By defautl, the adsr_envelope_gen makes 4 segments with types: 1 exp_upward_ramp_gen for the attack segment, with peak level of 1.0. 2 exp_downward_ramp_gen for the decay segment, with level set to the sustain level. 3 lin_downward_ramp_gen for the sustain segment.

For amplitudes gain, the relationship is given by: 20 log10(out/in) = dB where out represents the output amplitude, while in represents the input amplitude. The decibel scale is expressed as the base 10 logarithm of the ratio between two amplitudes. For instance, a ratio of 2:1 (two times) corresponds to a 6 dB increase, while a ratio of 10:1 (ten times) corresponds to a 20 dB increase. In contrast, a ratio of 1:2 (one half) corresponds to a -6 dB decrease, whereas a ratio of 1:10 (one tenth) corresponds to a -20 dB decrease.

A turn is abbreviated τ, cyc, rev, or rot depending on the application. The symbol τ can also be used as a mathematical constant to represent 2π radians. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_unit phase is represented in a fixed-point 1.31 format where 31 bits are fractional. Such a format is perfectly suitable for oscillators. For that purpose, a phase accumulator can be used: essentially a counter that keeps track of the current phase value for the waveform. Initially, the accumulator is set to an arbitrary starting phase, usually 0. To generate the next sample of the waveform, we compute the phase value for the next sample based on the desired frequency and the sample rate. This value is then added to the current phase accumulator value. This process continues for each successive sample in the waveform. The advantage of using fixed point 1.31 to represent phase is that the phase accumulator inherently rewraps the value when the next phase exceeds 2π. This behavior is inherent to the fixed-point 1.31 format and eliminates the need for additional logic to handle the wraparound condition.

The Q library comprises of two layers: q_io: Audio and MIDI I/O layer. The q_io layer provides cross-platform audio and MIDI host connectivity straight out of the box. The q_io layer is optional. The q_lib layer is usable without it. q_lib: The core DSP library, q_lib is a no-frills, lightweight, header-only library. The dependencies are determined by the arrows. q_io has very minimal dependencies (portaudio and portmidi) with very loose coupling via thin wrappers that are easy to transplant and port to a host, with or without an operating system, such as an audio plugin or direct to hardware ADC and DAC. q_io is used in the tests and examples, but can be easily replaced by other mechanisms in an application. Plugin libraries for DAWs (digital audio workstations), for example, have their own audio and MIDI I/O mechanisms. q_lib has no dependencies except the standard c++ library. The library is organized with this simplified directory structure: docs (1) example (2) q_io ├─ external (3) ├─ include (4) └─ src (5) q_lib └─ include (6) test (7) 1 Where this documentation resides. 2 Self-contained and easy to understand c++ programs that demonstrate various features of the library. 3 3rd party libraries used by the q_io module. 4 q_io header files. 5 q_io source files. 6 Header-only core q_lib DSP library. 7 A comprehensive set of c++ files for testing the library. Other sub-directories not listed here can be ignored. The q_lib module, header-only core, has this simplified directory structure: q_lib └─ include └─ q ├─ fft (1) ├─ fx (2) ├─ pitch (3) ├─ support (4) ├─ synth (5) └─ utility (6) 1 Fast fourier transform. 2 Various \"effects\" processor building blocks. 3 Pitch detection related facilities. 4 Fundamental support facilities. 5 Various synthesisers. 6 Auxiliary utility functions and classes. Other sub-directories not listed here can be ignored. All entities in the Q library are placed in namespace cycfi::q. Everywhere in this documentation, we will be using a namespace alias to make the code less verbose: namespace q = cycfi::q; Typical audio processors in the Q DSP library work on floating point input samples with the normal -1.0 to 1.0 range. However, values are not limited to sampled signals. For instance, signal envelopes are best represented as decibels that are processed in the logarithmic domain, so dynamic-range processors such as compressors and expanders accept decibel as input and return decibel as output. For example: decibel gain = comp(env); comp is a compressor. The compressor above, however, processes signal envelopes rather than raw samples, in contrast to the typical implementation of DSP compressors. The compressor above accepts an envelope represented by decibel, performs computation in the logarithmic domain, and returns a compressed envelope also represented by decibel. Oscillators, as another example, operate on phase-angle inputs and return output samples: float out = sin(phase++); The Q DSP library has a rich set of such types: float and double Typical sample data type -1.0 to 1.0 (or beyond for some computational headroom). frequency Cycles per second (Hz). duration A time span (seconds, milliseconds, etc.) period The inverse of frequency. phase Fixed point 1.31 format where 31 bits are fractional. phase. represents 0 to 2π phase values suitable for oscillators. decibel Ratio of one value to another on a logarithmic scale (dB). For more information, see Units. The Q DSP library is typeful and typesafe. You can not mismatch values of different types such as frequency and decibel, for example. Such potentially disastrous mistakes can happen if all values are just raw floating point types. There are conversions to and from these data types where it is reasonable to do so. decibel can, for example, be converted to 'float' or 'double' using the as_float or as_double conversion functions. Example: float gain = as_float(12_dB); Relational operations are allowed. For example: if (gain > 3_dB) // 3_dB is a decibel literal (see below) s = lp(s); Arithmetic operations are allowed. For example: auto total_duration = 3_ms + 5_ms; // 3_ms and 5_ms are duration literals Where appropriate, arithmetic with raw types are allowed. For example: auto harmonic = 440_Hz * 4; // 440_Hz is a frequency literal To augment the wealth of value types, the Q DSP library makes abundant use of user-defined literals. We take advantage of C++ type safe user-defined literals, instead of the usual float or double which can be unsafe when values of different units (e.g. frequency vs. duration) are mismatched. The Q DSP library makes abundant use of user-defined literals for units such as time, frequency and volume. For example, we use 24_dB, instead of a unit-less 24 or worse, a non-intuitive, unit-less 15.8 —the gain equivalent of 24_dB. Such constants also make the code very readable, another objective of this library. Q Literals are placed in the namespace q::literals. The namespace is sparse enough to be hoisted into your namespace using using namespace: To use these literals, include the literals.hpp header: #include then use the literals namespace somewhere in a scope where you need it: using namespace q::literals; Here are some example expressions: 82.4069_Hz 440_Hz 1.5_KHz 1.5_kHz 1_kHz 0.5_MHz 3_MHz 10.3_s 1_s 20.5_ms 1_ms 10.5_us 500_us -3.5_dB 10_dB 2_pi 0.5_pi Here’s the list of available literals: // frequency constexpr frequency operator \"\" _Hz(long double val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _Hz(unsigned long long int val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _KHz(long double val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _KHz(unsigned long long int val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _kHz(long double val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _kHz(unsigned long long int val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _MHz(long double val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _MHz(unsigned long long int val); // duration constexpr duration operator \"\" _s(long double val); constexpr duration operator \"\" _s(unsigned long long int val); constexpr duration operator \"\" _ms(long double val); constexpr duration operator \"\" _ms(unsigned long long int val); constexpr duration operator \"\" _us(long double val); constexpr duration operator \"\" _us(unsigned long long int val); // decibel constexpr decibel operator \"\" _dB(unsigned long long int val); constexpr decibel operator \"\" _dB(long double val); // pi constexpr long double operator \"\" _pi(long double val); constexpr long double operator \"\" _pi(unsigned long long int val) In the realm of electronic music, there are processors and synthesizers, whose definitions overlap somewhat and differ primarily in how they handle input and output. The processor receives one or more input samples and generates one or more output samples according to a specific processing algorithm. A synthesizer, on the other hand, generates sound from scratch without using any samples. The C++ function object is the most basic building block. In the Q world, both processors and synthesizers are simply function objects, which can be composed to form more complex functions. A function object can accept zero or more input values and generate zero or more output values. Function objects are instantiated from struct or class declarations in the header files. In this example, we instantiate hypothetical f_x and g_x structs: auto f = f_x{}; auto g = g_x{}; Syntactically, you can use these function objects just like any other function. Here’s an example function call invocation for the single input function object, f instantiated above: float r = f(s); where s is the input value, and f(s) returns a result and stores it in the variable r. Composition by passing the result of f to g, like this: float r = g(f(s)); can be encapsulated using function composition in a class or struct: struct fg_x { float operator()(float s) const { return g(f(s)); } f_x f; g_x g; }; Here, we encapsulate f_x and g_x inside the composed function object struct fg_x. We can then instantiate a function object for fg_x just like we would above. The Q DSP library uses fine-grained and reusable function object structs or classes like this. Such reusable components are composed to form more powerful higher level composites. Here’s the code example in the library for signal conditioning: inline float signal_conditioner::operator()(float s) { // High pass s = _hp(s); (1) // Pre clip s = _clip(s); (2) // Dynamic Smoother s = _sm(s); (3) // Signal envelope auto env = _env(std::abs(s)); (4) // Noise gate auto gate = _gate(env); (5) s *= _gate_env(gate); (6) // Compressor + makeup-gain auto env_db = decibel(env); auto gain = as_float(_comp(env_db)) * _makeup_gain; (7) s = s * gain; _post_env = env * gain; return s; } We’re showing only the operator() for brevity. But take note that the code uses multiple function objects for various processing functions that correspond to these class member variables: private: clip _clip; (2) highpass _hp; (1) dynamic_smoother _sm; (3) fast_envelope_follower _env; (4) float _post_env; compressor _comp; (7) float _makeup_gain; onset_gate _gate; (5) envelope_follower _gate_env; (6) }; The complete code can be found here: signal_conditioner.hpp Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Joel de Guzman.

The full example can be found here: example/delay.cpp. The example loads a pre-recorded wav file and plays it back with processing. The raw audio source will be played in the left channel while the delayed signal will be played in the right channel. Pretty much as straightforward as possible. The audio will be played using the currently selected audio device. The final audio output can be heard below: Your browser does not support the audio tag. // fractional delay (1) q::delay _delay{350_ms, 44100}; // Mix the signal s, and the delayed signal (where s is the incoming sample) (2) auto _y = s + _delay(); // Feed back the result to the delay (2) _delay.push(_y * _feedback); Normally, there will be a processing loop that receives the incoming samples, s. The code above are placed: 1 Before the processing loop. 2 Inside inside the processing loop. Typically, you encapsulate the code inside a class where _delay, _y and _feedback are member variables. 44100 is the desired sampling rate. _feedback is the amount of feedback desired (anything from 0.0 to less than 1.0, e.g. 0.85). 350_ms is the delay duration. Take note of 350_ms. Here, we take advantage of C++ type safe user-defined literals, instead of the usual float or double which can be unsafe when values of different units (e.g. frequency vs. duration) are mismatched. The Q DSP library makes abundant use of user-defined literals for units such as time, frequency and volume. For example, we use 24_dB, instead of a unit-less 24 or worse, a non-intuitive, unit-less 15.8 —the gain equivalent of 24_dB. Such constants also make the code very readable, another objective of this library. Processors such as q::delay are C++ function objects that can be composed to form more complex processors. For example if you want to filter the delayed signal with a low-pass filter with a 1 kHz cutoff frequency, you apply the q::lowpass filter over the result of the delay: q::lowpass _lp{1_kHz, 44100}; then insert the filter where it is needed in the processing loop: // Add the signal s, and the delayed, low-pass filtered signal auto _y = s + _lp(_delay()); Let us move on to a more elaborate example. How about a fully functional, bandwidth limited square wave synthesizer with ADSR envelope that controls an amplifier and a resonant filter and control the note-on and note-off using MIDI? Sounds good? This example is complete and self-contained in one .cpp file, kept as simple as possible to highlight the ease-of-use. The full example can be found here: example/square_synth.cpp. In order to run this example, you will need a MIDI input device connected to your system, preferrably a keyboard. Make sure you have at least one installed. If you do not have a physical MIDI input device, you can install one of the MIDI onscreen keyboards. For example, MidiKeys is a small application for MacOS that presents a MIDI keyboard onscreen. Here’s a short video clip: After building the program, make sure you have a MIDI keyboard connected before starting the application. At startup, the app will present you with a list of available MIDI hardware and will ask you what you want to use. Example: ================================================================================ Available MIDI Devices (ID : \"Name\" inputs/outputs): 0 : \"Quantum 2626\" 1/0 1 : \"Code 61 USB MIDI\" 1/0 2 : \"Code 61 MIDI DIN\" 1/0 3 : \"Code 61 Mackie/HUI\" 1/0 4 : \"Code 61 Editor\" 1/0 5 : \"Quantum 2626\" 0/1 6 : \"Code 61 USB MIDI\" 0/1 7 : \"Code 61 MIDI DIN\" 0/1 8 : \"Code 61 Mackie/HUI\" 0/1 9 : \"Code 61 Editor\" 0/1 ================================================================================ Choose MIDI Device ID: 1 And then a list of audio devices to choose from. Example: ================================================================================ Available Audio Devices (ID : \"Name\" inputs/outputs): 1 : \"MacBook Air Microphone\" 1/0 2 : \"MacBook Air Speakers\" 0/2 3 : \"Quantum 2626\" 26/26 ================================================================================ Choose Audio Device ID: 3 Take note that the demo is a console application. The Q library does not have a GUI, for good reason! We want to keep it as simple as possible. The GUI is taken cared of by other libraries (e.g. Elements). After choosing the MIDI and Audio driver, the synth is playable. The synth is monophonic and responds to velocity only, for simplicity. There are more demo applications in the example directory. After this quick tutorial, feel free to explore. Here’s the actual synthesizer with the processing loop: struct my_square_synth : q::audio_stream { my_square_synth(q::adsr_envelope_gen::config env_cfg, int device_id) : audio_stream(q::audio_device::get(device_id), 0, 2) , env(env_cfg, this->sampling_rate()) , filter(0.5, 0.8) {} void process(out_channels const& out) { auto left = out[0]; auto right = out[1]; for (auto frame : out.frames()) { // Generate the ADSR envelope auto env_ = env() * velocity; // Set the filter frequency filter.cutoff(env_); // Synthesize the square wave auto val = q::square(phase++); // Apply the envelope (amplifier and filter) with soft clip val = clip(filter(val) * env_); // Output right[frame] = left[frame] = val; } } q::phase_iterator phase; // The phase iterator q::adsr_envelope_gen env; // The envelope generator q::reso_filter filter; // The resonant filter q::soft_clip clip; // Soft clip float velocity; // Note-on velocity }; Our synth, a subclass of q::audio_stream, sets up buffers for the input and output audio streams and presents those to our processing loop (the process function above). In this example, we setup an audio stream with the selected device, no inputs and two (stereo) outputs: audio_stream(q::audio_device::get(device_id), 0, 2) Behind the scenes, there’s a lot going on here, actually. But you will notice that emphasis is given to making the library very readable, easy to understand and follow, by breaking down complex tasks into smaller manageable tasks and using function composition at progressively higher levels, while maintaining simplicity and clarity of intent. The synthesizer above is composed of smaller building blocks: fine grained C++ function objects. For example, here’s the square wave oscillator (bandwidth limited using poly_blep). For now, we will skim over details such as the adsr_envelope_gen, phase, and phase_iterator, and this thing called poly_blep. The important point, exemplified here, is that we want to keep our building blocks as simple and minimal as possible. We will cover these in greater detail later. The astute reader may notice that our square_osc class does not even have state! struct square_osc { constexpr float operator()(phase p, phase dt) const { constexpr auto middle = phase::middle(); auto r = p < middle ? 1.0f : -1.0f; // Correct rising discontinuity r += poly_blep(p, dt); // Correct falling discontinuity r -= poly_blep(p + middle, dt); return r; } constexpr float operator()(phase_iterator i) const { return (*this)(i._phase, i._incr); } }; constexpr auto square = square_osc{}; Yeah, that’s the complete oscillator. That’s all there is to it! The modern C++ savvy programmer will immediately notice the use of constexpr, applied judiciously all throughout the library. Such modern C++ facilities allow the compiler to generate extremely efficient code, even those that are generated at compile time. That means, for this example, that one can build an oscillator at compile time if needed, perhaps with constant wavetable results stored in read-only memory. The midi_processor takes care of MIDI events. Your application will have its own MIDI processor that deals with MIDI events that you are interested in. For this simple example, we simply want to process note-on and note-off events. On note-on events, our MIDI processor sets `my_square_synth’s note frequency and velocity and triggers its envelope for attack. On note-off events, our MIDI processor initiates the envelope’s release. struct my_midi_processor : midi::processor { using midi::processor::operator(); my_midi_processor(my_square_synth& synth) : _synth(synth) {} void operator()(midi::note_on msg, std::size_t time) { _key = msg.key(); auto freq = midi::note_frequency(_key); _synth.phase.set(freq, _synth.sampling_rate()); _synth.env.attack(); _synth.velocity = float(msg.velocity()) / 128; } void operator()(midi::note_off msg, std::size_t time) { if (msg.key() == _key) _synth.env.release(); } std::uint8_t _key; my_square_synth& _synth; }; In the main function, we instantiate my_square_synth and my_midi_processor. The synth constructor, in case you haven’t noticed yet, requires an envelope configuration (envelope::config). Here, we provide our configuration. Take note that in this example, the envelope parameters are constant, for the sake of simplicity, but you can definitely have these controllable by the user by writing your own MIDI processor that deals with MIDI control change messages. Again, take note of the abundant use of user-defined literals for units such as duration (e.g. 100_ms) and level (e.g. -12_dB). auto env_cfg = q::envelope::config { 100_ms // attack rate , 1_s // decay rate , -12_dB // sustain level , 5_s // sustain rate , 1_s // release rate }; my_square_synth synth{ env_cfg }; Then, we create my_midi_processor, giving it a reference to my_square_synth. We’ll also need a midi_input_stream that receives the actual incoming MIDI messages from the chosen hardware. q::midi_input_stream stream; my_midi_processor proc{ synth }; Now we’re all set. We start the synth and enter a loop that exits when the user presses ctrl-c (in which case the running flag becomes false). In the loop, we give our MIDI processor a chance to process incoming MIDI events as they arrive from the MIDI stream: synth.start(); while (running) stream.process(proc); synth.stop(); Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Joel de Guzman.

The dynamic range of an audio signal is the difference between its loudest and quietest components. Compression, Expansion, Limiting, and Gating are a few common types of dynamic range processing used in audio DSP. Such processing can enhance sound quality, minimize or eliminate noise, and create creative effects. The dynamic range processors in the Q DSP library are unique in that they do not process audio waveform samples directly. Instead, they operate on the envelope of the audio signal, represented as decibel, perform computations in the logarithmic domain, and return a processed envelope, also represented as decibel. As an example, here’s the processing code for the compressor: decibel compressor::operator()(decibel env) const { if (env <= _threshold) return 0_dB; return _slope * (_threshold - env); } This is a hard knee compressor: a type of compressor in which the compression ratio changes abruptly when the input signal exceeds the threshold level, known as the knee point. Both hard knee and soft knee compressors are supported by the Q DSP library. The code accepts an envelope input, env, in decibels and outputs a compressed envelope also in decibels. Processing is done in the logarithmic domain, where addition of two values is equivalent to multiplying their corresponding linear values, and multiplication of two values is equivalent to raising their corresponding linear values to a power. The envelope follower, which is responsible for generating the input envelope for the compressor, is implemented outside of the compressor class. The objective is separation of concerns and the flexibility to use various envelope followers. Compared to their linear counterparts, performing computations in the logarithmic domain is simpler, more intuitive, and makes the code easier to understand while maintaining the same level of efficiency. The compressor example above and all dynamic range processors in the Q DSP library are essentially envelope processors. They receive envelopes, process envelopes, and return envelopes. Since envelope processors operate on the envelope, perform computations in the logarithmic domain, and return a processed envelope, multiple envelope processors can be cascaded. For instance, you can use a single envelope follower and apply the derived envelope to an expander and then pass the result to a compressor, like in the diagram below: A specific use-case for cascading an expander and a compressor, like in the example above, is when you want to use the expander as a noise gate, with soft, non-abrupt gating, set at a threshold just above the noise floor. Then, setting the threshold of the compressor to a high value to even out the dynamic range. The compressor and expander in this case work on different regions of the full dynamic range. But there are also useful cases where the overlap of dynamic ranges the processors are working on is advantageous. The compressor-limiter is a good example. Likewise, multiple compressors with variable thresholds and ratios are another example. By cascading multiple dynamic range processors, we can design efficient multi-function processors like the compressor-limiter with gate (transfer response graph at the right).","title":"Dynamic","component":"q","version":"v1.0","name":"dynamic","url":"/q/v1.0/reference/dynamic.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Example","hash":"_example","id":2},{"text":"Key Points","hash":"_key_points","id":3},{"text":"Cascading","hash":"_cascading","id":4}]},"81":{"id":81,"text":"This section deals with envelope extraction from signals. In audio DSP, an envelope refers to the time-varying changes of a signal. It essentially represents the \"shape\" of the signal in terms of its moment-to-moment changes. Extracting an envelope from a signal is particularly important because they can be used for a variety of processing tasks, including controlling the perceived loudness of a signal, reducing noise, emphasizing particular elements of the signal, modulating amplitude, frequency, and other sound properties, to name a few. Envelopes are typically, but not always, related to amplitude changes, although it can sometimes be related to other parameters like pitch or frequency, phase, and filter cutoff, to name a few. This section will only cover amplitude envelope extraction. Figure 1. Output behavior of different types of envelope followers. The amplitude envelope can also be used to extract dynamic features from a sound. As an example, onset detection is a method for determining the beginning of each musical note. The most basic onset detection scheme involves analyzing the amplitude envelope and detecting sudden changes in amplitude that coincide with the start of each note. [1] The Q DSP library includes a variety of envelope extractors, ranging from the most basic peak envelope follower to the more precise, but computationally demanding, fast RMS envelope follower. Each has distinct strengths, characteristics, and tradeoffs that can be evaluated based on the application’s specific requirements. Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Joel de Guzman. All rights reserved.

It is also the most common filter in DSP primarily due to its simplicity. But while it is technically a low pass FIR filter, it performs poorly in the frequency domain with very slow roll-off and dreadful stopband attenuation. On the other hand, it performs admirably in the time domain. The moving average filter is optimal in reducing random noise while retaining a sharp step response. Averaging N samples (the moving average window size) increases the SNR by the square root of N. For example, N=16 improves SNR by 4 (12dB). The filter delay is exactly (N−1)/2. Figure 1. Moving Average When data is pushed into a moving average, the element indices are shifted by one position to accommodate the incoming data. This logical shifting ensures that the newest data is stored in the first index (index 0), while the oldest data is pushed out of the buffer.

The window moves through the data one point at a time as new samples arrive, and at each step, the sum of the data points within the window is calculated. Instead of calculating the sum of all elements in the window each time, an efficient scheme keeps a continuous total and subtracts the last element that will fall off the window when a new sample arrives. Figure 1. Moving Sum When data is pushed into a moving sum, the element indices are shifted by one position to accommodate the incoming data. This logical shifting ensures that the newest data is stored in the first index (index 0), while the oldest data is pushed out of the buffer. The physical location of data does not actually change, only the indices. basic_moving_sum is a template class representing moving sums with provision for specifying the element type, T.

The rest of the q_lib layer is usable without it. q_io is primarily used in the tests and examples, but can be easily replaced by other mechanisms in an application. Plugin libraries for DAWs (digital audio workstations), for example, have their own audio and MIDI I/O mechanisms. q_io was intended to be very minimal. The entire layer is comprised of a handful of classes. The diagram below depicts the data transfer between the various components, an application, and the host operating system. audio_device audio_device represents individual audio interfaces on the host platform. There are typically one or more audio devices available. Each device has a name, device identifier, and specific capabilities, including sample rate and the number of input and output channels supported. audio_stream audio_stream handles audio input and output to and from an audio device. Parameters such as sample rate, sample format, and buffer size are specified when opening the audio stream. Audio streams can be input only, output only, or both input and output. Data is transmitted asynchronously between an open audio stream and the application. audio_file audio_file is a set of small and lightweight classes for reading and writing WAV (Waveform Audio File Format) files. It offers a straightforward and intuitive interface for working with WAV audio data. midi_device midi_device is an abstraction which encapsulates the properties and functionality of a MIDI interface. Each MIDI device includes information such as its name, device identifier, and the number of inputs and outputs available. midi_input_stream The midi_input_stream class facilitates MIDI communication and data transmission of MIDI messages between a MIDI device and an application. The application processes audio, asynchronoously, via user provided process functions as documented in the Audio Stream Client Interface.

What makes synthesizers so engaging is the level of control they offer over sound creation. A synthesizer allows a user to shape and mold a sound by adjusting parameters such as waveform shape, frequency, amplitude, and filter settings. This level of control enables users to create expressive and unique sounds that can be used in a variety of contexts, ranging from music production to sound design for film and video games. The advancements in DSP technology have made synthesizers even more powerful and flexible. Users can now create sounds that were previously impossible to achieve with traditional analog synthesizers. The Q DSP library provides some common synthesisers such as sine-wave, square, pulse, triangle and saw-tooth, as well as various generators for sculpting the sound envelopes with controls for attack, decay, hold sustain and release. These are designed as moduler building blocks that are combined to form more complex synthesisers. Oscillator is a concept representation of an oscillator that generates periodic waveforms. Oscillators are function objects that take in a phase_iterator: an iterator over the phase. The output is typically a floating point value. namespace cycfi::q::concepts { template concept Oscillator = std::copy_constructible && std::assignable_from && std::default_initializable && requires(T o, T a, T b, phase_iterator pi) { o(pi); // Generate a periodic waveform given `{phase_iterator}`, `pi`. }; } o, a, b Instances of types that conform to Oscillator. pi Object of type phase_iterator.

These processors typically operate with floating-point input samples in the typical -1.0 to 1.0 range. However, the values are not restricted to sampled signals. For instance, signal envelopes are best represented as decibels processed in the logarithmic domain. Consequently, dynamic-range processors such as compressors and expanders accept decibel as input and return decibel as output. The Q DSP library is typeful and typesafe, which means that each data type is explicitly defined and enforced. This is crucial because it avoids the potentially catastrophic errors that could result from mismatching values of different types. For example, if all values were just raw floating point types, it would be possible to accidentally mix up the frequency and decibel values. Mistakenly interchanging frequency and decibel values could result in erroneous processing of the audio signal and will lead to undefined results. This document aims to provide comprehensive documentation of the fundamental data types used by the Q DSP library. These basic units are utilized consistently throughout the library and serve as the basis for quantifying specific parameters, such as decibels (dB) for signal level and hertz (Hz) for frequency.

During the attack phase of an audio signal, the AR envelope follower attempts to follow the signal but is constrained by the attack duration. A longer attack period gives a softer response, exponentially increasing. When the signal level drops below the peak, the follower gradually releases the peak level with an exponential decay. The AR envelope follower models the behavior of two resistors, one for attack, and one for release, each connected in series with an ideal diode —with no voltage drop—, tied together and connected to a capacitor. During attacks, the capacitor charges through the attack resistor, exponentially increasing. The capacitor discharges through the release resistor as the audio signal falls below the peak charge, causing the output voltage to progressively decay with an exponential curve. Figure 1.

Following the fast envelope follower API, the function call operator accepts a floating point sample, transforms it, and returns an envelope, also a floating point. The fast_rms_envelope_follower_db variant works in the dB domain, making it easy to use as an envelope follower for dynamic range effects (compressor, expander, and agc) that already work in the dB domain, so we eliminate a linear to decibel conversion and optimize computation by using division by 2 instead of sqrt as an added bonus. The plot in Figure 1 below shows the fast RMS envelope follower’s response (envelope: green, signal: blue, absolute value of the signal: dark blue). It may look indistinguishable from the Fast Averaging Envelope Follower's output, but this detector returns true RMS results. Figure 1.

When the signal level drops below the peak, the follower gradually releases the peak level with an exponential decay. This allows the follower to accurately capture the dynamic changes in the audio signal while avoiding sudden downward fluctuations. The peak envelope follower models the behavior of an ideal diode —with no voltage drop— connected in series with a resistor and a capacitor connected in parallel. The ideal diode allows the positive peaks of the audio signal to pass through, charging the capacitor to the maximum. When the signal falls below the peak, the capacitor discharges through the resistor, causing the output voltage to gradually decay with an exponential curve, following the release time constant. Figure 1. Peak envelope follower response The plot in Figure 1 depicts the response of the peak envelope follower, which was obtained by picking the guitar’s low-E string and using a 2-second release duration (envelope: orange, signal: blue, absolute value of the signal: dark blue). It is worth noting that we use the absolute value of the signal to capture both the positive and negative sides of the waveform, as indicated by the dark blue plot. The peak envelope follower does not perform this operation automatically, allowing you to perform any necessary preprocessing before computing the envelope. This flexibility enables you, for example, to capture only the positive or negative peaks, or perhaps the square of the signal, depending on your application needs. The peak envelope follower can track fast attack transients, but cannot track downward slopes faster than the specified release duration. However, reducing the release duration too much can reveal envelope ripples. When the release duration is too fast, the peak envelope follower quickly releases the previous cycle’s peak and begins tracking the peak of the next cycle, causing ripples in the envelope follower’s output, as shown in the image on the right. Such ripples can cause unwanted modulation and can be heard as distortion or noise in the audio signal. Further low-pass filtering can reduce the ripples at the expense of smearing the attack shape. #include struct peak_envelope_follower { peak_envelope_follower(duration release, float sps); float operator()(float s); float operator()() const; peak_envelope_follower& operator=(float y); void release(duration release_, float sps); }; env, a, b Objects of type peak_envelope_follower rel Object of type duration sps Floating point value for samples per second. s Floating point value for the latest input sample. y Floating point value from 0.0 to 1.0.

They introduce repetitions of the original signal, resulting in spacious soundscapes and echoes. The number of repetitions is controlled via feedback. The interval between the initial signal and the repetitions is altered by adjusting the delay time. Longer durations provide echoes, whereas shorter delays produce doubling effects. Filters can shape the repeating signals, influencing their tonal properties. Delays are also essential for modulation effects such as flangers and choruses, which are created by dynamically modulating delay times using low-frequency oscillators (LFOs). basic_delay is a basic class for delays. The actual delay duration parameter is decoupled from, and managed outside the class to allow both single and multi-tapped delays.

This may include extracting note data, control change values, program change commands, or any other MIDI message content that is of interest to the user. #include // Concepts namespace cycfi::q::concepts::midi_1_0 { /**...**/ } // API and Implementation namespace cycfi::q::midi_1_0 { /**...**/ } Currently, the Q DSP library supports MIDI 1.0, implemented in namespace midi_1_0. namespace cycfi::q::concepts { namespace midi_1_0 { template concept Processor = requires(T&& proc, q::midi_1_0::message_base const& msg, std::size_t time) { proc(msg, time); }; } } Processor is a concept that represents a MIDI 1.0 processor. It is placed inside namespace midi_1_0 to distinguish it from future MIDI processors. Essentially, the C++ concept states that: Processor has a function call operator that accepts a MIDI 1.0 message and a time stamp. The MIDI 1.0 message, msg, is derived from message_base. The time stamp is represented as a millisecond clock with an undefined arbitrary start time. proc Instance of a type that conforms to Processor. msg Instance of a type that conforms to Message. time A std::size_t time stamp. Expression Semantics Return Type proc(msg, time) Process the MIDI message, msg at time stamp time. void processor is a basic class that conforms to the Processor concept, but does nothing by default. struct processor { void operator()(message_base const& msg, std::size_t time) {} }; This utility class provides the default no-op handling. It is intended to be derived from. Thus, the derived class can overload specific function call operators for messages it is interested with. Example: namespace midi = cycfi::q::midi_1_0; struct my_midi_processor : midi::processor { using midi::processor::operator(); void operator()(midi::note_on msg, std::size_t time); void operator()(midi::note_off msg, std::size_t time); }; In this example, my_midi_processor is interested with, and processes only note_on and note_off messages. The dispatch takes in a raw MIDI 1.0 message (raw_message), a time stamp, and a Processor. It converts the raw MIDI message to a specific MIDI message, and dispatches the message to the processor, along with the time stamp. template requires concepts::Processor void dispatch(raw_message msg, std::size_t time, P&& proc); This function is the basic low-level hook for dispatching raw MIDI messages obtained by an I/O system from MIDI devices.","title":"MIDI Processor","component":"q","version":"v1.0","name":"midi_processor","url":"/q/v1.0/reference/support/midi_processor.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Include","hash":"_include","id":2},{"text":"Namespaces","hash":"_namespaces","id":3},{"text":"Declaration","hash":"_declaration","id":4},{"text":"Expressions","hash":"_expressions","id":5},{"text":"Notation","hash":"_notation","id":6},{"text":"Function Call","hash":"_function_call","id":7},{"text":"processor","hash":"_processor","id":8},{"text":"Dispatch","hash":"_dispatch","id":9}]},"121":{"id":121,"text":"Read Basic Concepts first for prerequisite information. Multi-buffer presents a multi-channel buffer arranged in a non-interleaved format where each channel has its own dedicated buffer, and the samples within each buffer are arranged sequentially in contiguous memory locations. The non-interleaved format is ideal for digital signal processing where it is necessary to perform operations on individual channels separately, often in parallel for maximum efficiency. As an example, the figure below shows the memory layout of a 4-channel non-interleaved format. Figure 1. 4 Channel Non-Interleaved Format A Multi-buffer can be conceptualized as a two-dimensional array. The first dimension in this representation corresponds to the samples (x-dimension), while the second dimension represents the channels (y-dimension). Essentially, you can access each individual sample using the two indices ch and i, where ch is the channel index and i is the sample index. mb[ch][i] Each dimension has a size which can be obtained this way: mb.size() // The number of channels mb[ch].size() // The number of frames per channel That way, you can iterate through the channels and samples this way: for (auto ch = 0; ch != mb.size() ++ch) { for (auto i = 0; i != mb[ch].size() ++i) { auto s = mb[ch][i]; // Do something with the sample `s` } } Alternately, you can iterate through the channels and samples in a channel, using C++ range-based for loop syntax, as follows: for (auto ch : mb.channels) { for (auto i : mb.frames) { auto s = mb[ch][i]; // Do something with the sample `s` } } Take note that this syntax is unorthodox in the way it uses C++ range-based for loop syntax. Instead of accessing the channels and samples directly, mb.channels and mb.frames both return a range of indices (corresponding to 0..N, where N is number of channels, for mb.channels or samples, for mb.frames). The design rationale is to always allow random access to all channels and all samples for each channel. For example, you might want to access both the left and right channels of a stereo (2-channel) multi-buffer and mix them: auto left = mb[0]; auto right = mb[1]; for (auto i : mb.frames) { auto mono = right[i] + left[i]; // Add the left and right channels // Do something with `mono` } mb[ch] returns a view of the channel. It does not copy the whole buffer. This \"view\" is lightweight and can be held and passed by value without worrying about performance. The previous example can extend to an N channel mixer this way: for (auto i : mb.frames) { auto sum = 0.0f; for (auto ch : mb.channels) sum += mb[ch][i]; // Do something with `sum` } If you simply need sequential access to the samples in a channel, you can do it this way: for (auto ch : mb.channels) { for (auto s : mb[ch]) { // Do something with the sample `s` } } #include template class multi_buffer { public: using sample_type = T; using buffer_view = iterator_range; using frames_view = iterator_range; using channels_view = iterator_range; // Unspecified constructor buffer_view operator[](std::size_t channel) const; std::size_t size() const; frames_view frames; channels_view channels; }; multi_buffer is a template class that implements the multi-buffer. The template paratemeter, T, is the sample type which is a model of the std::floating_point concept. iterator_range is a template class that holds two random access iterators. It is a model of IndexableContainer, and RandomAccessIteratable. The template parameter, I, is the iterator type. index_iterator is a model of the std::random_access_iterator concept.

It is often used in digital signal processing to smooth a signal (smoothing discontinuities at the edges of sampled signals) or to reduce spectral leakage. The Blackman window has a wider main lobe and lower level side lobes than other windows. It is named after Robert Blackman, who first described it in 1958. The formula for the Blackman window is: w(n) = 0.42 - 0.5 * cos(2pi*n/(N-1)) + 0.08 * cos(4pi*n/(N-1)) Aside from its common use as a window function, the Q DSP library also utilizes the blackman window generator for modulating the audio signal and generating complex envelopes. #include struct blackman_gen { blackman_gen(duration width, float sps); float operator()(); void config(duration width, float sps; void reset(); void midpoint(); }; blackman_gen is a model of Generator.

Each segment is a Ramp that can be configured to have any conceivable shape. A few ramp shapes, including exponential, linear, blackman, and hann are provided. The user may add their own Ramp generator following a well defined c++ concept specification. The plot above is an example of a 5-segment envelope_gen output. The ramp segments S1 to S5 are as follows: blackman_upward_ramp_gen (see blackman_gen) hold_line_gen (see linear_gen) blackman_downward_ramp_gen (see blackman_gen) lin_downward_ramp_gen (see linear_gen) exp_downward_ramp_gen (see exponential_gen) The phases and transitions of the envelope gen are depicted in the following stylized state diagram. There are four phases of interest: Idle phase: The output sits at zero while waiting for the next attack signal Ⓐ. Attack phase: Initiated when the attack signal Ⓐ is received, e.g. when a key is pressed. Intermediate phase: Starts after the attack phase and ends before the release phase. Release phase: Initiated when the release signal Ⓡ is received, e.g when the key is released. The envelope_gen waits for an attack signal Ⓐ while in the idle phase. As soon as an attack signal Ⓐ is received, the state immediately transitions to the attack phase. The output ramps up from 0.0 to the specified attack level, over the specified attack duration. The envelope gen is not retriggerable. Attack signals Ⓐ are only permitted during the idle phase. Any attack signal Ⓐ received outside of the idle phase is disregarded. Use one envelope_gen instance per note. This is most natural with polyphonic voicing, but can also apply to monophonic voicing. For monophonic voicing, on an incoming attack signal Ⓐ, active instances are sent release signals Ⓡ, a new instance is created, and its attack phase is initiated. The output will then be the maximum of all active instances. After the attack phase, anything that comes in between the attack phase and release phase are intermmediate phases that are sequenced by the envelope_gen, one after the other. Intermmediate phases may include the decay phase, the hold phase and the sustain phase. For each intermediate phase, the output ramps up or down from the previous level to the phase’s level over the phase’s duration. Upon receiving the release signal Ⓡ, the envelope_gen immediately transitions to the release phase. This may occur at any point during the attack or intermediate phases. The current phase may be cut short when this happens, and without delay, the output ramps down to 0.0 over the specified release duration. Typically, the last intermediate segment is configured with a very long duration (e.g. for sustain), and normally a release signal Ⓡ will occur long before the last intermediate segment ends. If that is not the case, like for example if the sustain segment is a relatively short linear down ramp, it is possible to transition to the release phase before a release signal Ⓡ is received. After completion of the release phase, the envelope_gen returns back to the idle state. Each envelope segment has parameters for width (the duration of the segment), level (the end level of the segment), and of course the Ramp type. A make_envelope_segment free function, templated on the ramp type, is provided for making segments. #include struct envelope_segment { envelope_segment(envelope_segment const&); envelope_segment& operator=(envelope_segment const&); void level(float level); void config(duration width, float sps); void config(float level, duration width, float sps); /*** Unspecified member functions ***/ }; template inline envelope_segment make_envelope_segment(duration width, float level, float sps); s, a, b Objects of type envelope_segment. w Object of type duration. l Floating point value representing level (0.0 to 1.0). sps Floating point value representing samples per second. T Ramp type. Expression Semantics envelope_segment(s) Copy construct from s. a = b Assign b to a. Expression Semantics Return Type make_envelope_segment( w, l, sps) Make an envelope segment with specified Ramp type, T, level, l, width, w, and samples per second, sps. envelope_segment // Make a 10 ms exponential segment with a peak level of 1.0. auto s = make_envelope_segment(10_ms, 1.0f, sps); Expression Semantics s.level(l) Set the segment level to l. s.config(w, sps) Set the segment width, w, with samples per second, sps. s.config(l, w, sps) Set the segment level, l, width, w, with samples per second, sps. The envelope generator is basically a container (std::vector) of envelope segments. Multiple segments with distinct shape characteristics may be used to construct ADSR envelopes, AD envelopes, etc. #include struct envelope_gen : std::vector { using base_type = std::vector; template envelope_gen(T&& ...arg); void attack(); void release(); float operator()(); void reset(); float current() const; bool in_idle_phase() const; bool in_attack_phase() const; bool in_release_phase() const; std::size_t index() const; }; As a subclass of std::vector, you can use all the facilities of std::vector to compose a multi-segment envelope generator of varying complexity. Take note of the single forwarding constructor that accepts variable arguments. Its purpose is to reset envelope_gen automatically after construction. All arguments are forwarded to the base class. envelope_gen is a subclass of std::vector and inherits all the publicly accessible member functions, member variables, and types of its base class. In addition to valid expressions for std::vector, envelope_gen allows these expressions. g Object of type envelope_gen. Expression Semantics Return Type g() Generate the next value. float Expression Semantics g.attack() Start the attack phase. g.release() Start the release phase. g.reset() Reset and move to the idle phase. Call envelope_gen::reset() whenever the segments change, such as when adding or removing segments from the segments container, to reset envelope_gen to the idle state. Expression Semantics Return Type g.current() Get the current level. float g.in_idle_phase() Return true if we are in the idle phase. bool g.in_attack_phase() Return true if we are in the attack phase. bool g.in_release_phase() Return true if we are in the release phase. bool g.index() Get the current index — the index of the latest active segment. std::size_t adsr_envelope_gen is a subclass of envelope_gen that offers specializations for generating envelopes of the ADSR type. This is a basic subclass that serves as a practical and prototypical envelope generator example. We will provide the full source code below, as an example of how to write an envelope generator. #include struct adsr_envelope_gen : envelope_gen { struct config { // Default settings duration attack_rate = 30_ms; duration decay_rate = 70_ms; decibel sustain_level = -6_dB; duration sustain_rate = 50_s; duration release_rate = 100_ms; }; adsr_envelope_gen(config const& config, float sps); void attack_rate(duration rate, float sps); void decay_rate(duration rate, float sps); void sustain_level(decibel level); void sustain_rate(duration rate, float sps); void release_rate(duration rate, float sps); }; inline adsr_envelope_gen::adsr_envelope_gen(config const& config_, float sps) : envelope_gen{ make_envelope_segment( config_.attack_rate, 1.0f, sps) // Attack (1) , make_envelope_segment( config_.decay_rate, lin_float(config_.sustain_level), sps) // Decay (2) , make_envelope_segment( config_.sustain_rate, 0.0f, sps) // Sustain (3) , make_envelope_segment( config_.release_rate, 0.0f, sps) // Release (4) } { } The config struct contains the constructor specifications for the ADSR paramneters, including attack_rate, decay_rate, sustain_level, sustain_rate, and release_rate. The user may specify these parameters like in this example: // Configure the adsr_envelope_gen auto env_cfg = q::adsr_envelope_gen::config { 300_ms // attack rate , 1_s // decay rate , -12_dB // sustain level , 5_s // sustain rate , 1_s // release rate }; // Instantiate an adsr_envelope_gen auto env_gen = q::adsr_envelope_gen{env_cfg, sps}; These parameters are used to construct the 4 segments comprising an ADSR envelope generator. Each of the segments are created using make_envelope_segment, passing in the Ramp type and the level, width, and samples per second. By defautl, the adsr_envelope_gen makes 4 segments with types: 1 exp_upward_ramp_gen for the attack segment, with peak level of 1.0. 2 exp_downward_ramp_gen for the decay segment, with level set to the sustain level. 3 lin_downward_ramp_gen for the sustain segment. This is a 5-second decaying linear ramp. 4 exp_downward_ramp_gen for the release segment, with level of 0.0. The remaining items are self-explanatory. These member functions permit the user to modify the five ADSR parameters following construction. The envelope segments are stored at indices 0 to 3 in the vector. // Set the attack rate inline void adsr_envelope_gen::attack_rate(duration rate, float sps) { (*this)[0].config(rate, sps); } // Set the decay rate inline void adsr_envelope_gen::decay_rate(duration rate, float sps) { (*this)[1].config(rate, sps); } // Set the sustain level inline void adsr_envelope_gen::sustain_level(decibel level) { (*this)[2].level(lin_float(level)); } // Set the sustain rate inline void adsr_envelope_gen::sustain_rate(duration rate, float sps) { (*this)[2].config(rate, sps); } // Set the release rate inline void adsr_envelope_gen::release_rate(duration rate, float sps) { (*this)[3].config(rate, sps); }","title":"Envelope Generator","component":"q","version":"v1.0","name":"envelope_gen","url":"/q/v1.0/reference/synth/envelope_gen.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Phases and Transitions","hash":"_phases_and_transitions","id":2},{"text":"Envelope Segment","hash":"_envelope_segment","id":3},{"text":"Include","hash":"_include","id":4},{"text":"Declaration","hash":"_declaration","id":5},{"text":"Expressions","hash":"_expressions","id":6},{"text":"Notation","hash":"_notation","id":7},{"text":"Constructors and Assignment","hash":"_constructors_and_assignment","id":8},{"text":"Factory","hash":"_factory","id":9},{"text":"Example","hash":"_example","id":10},{"text":"Mutators","hash":"_mutators","id":11},{"text":"Envelope Generator","hash":"_envelope_generator","id":12},{"text":"Include","hash":"_include_2","id":13},{"text":"Declaration","hash":"_declaration_2","id":14},{"text":"Expressions","hash":"_expressions_2","id":15},{"text":"Notation","hash":"_notation_2","id":16},{"text":"Function Call","hash":"_function_call","id":17},{"text":"Operation","hash":"_operation","id":18},{"text":"Accessors","hash":"_accessors","id":19},{"text":"ADSR Envelope Generator","hash":"_adsr_envelope_generator","id":20},{"text":"Include","hash":"_include_3","id":21},{"text":"Declaration","hash":"_declaration_3","id":22},{"text":"Implementation","hash":"_implementation","id":23},{"text":"Constructor","hash":"_constructor","id":24},{"text":"Mutators","hash":"_mutators_2","id":25}]},"124":{"id":124,"text":"exp_upward_ramp_gen is an exponential upward ramp generator that generates an exponentially increasing amplitude from 0.0 to 1.0, similar to a capacitor charged by a series resistor over time specified by the duration (width) and samples per second (sps), and optional exponential curvature (cv) parameters. exp_downward_ramp_gen is the inverse of the exponential upward ramp generator.

It is a logarithmic scale that expresses the relationship between two signal root-power amplitudes or power levels. Here, we are concerned with amplitudes. For amplitudes gain, the relationship is given by: 20 log10(out/in) = dB where out represents the output amplitude, while in represents the input amplitude. The decibel scale is expressed as the base 10 logarithm of the ratio between two amplitudes. For instance, a ratio of 2:1 (two times) corresponds to a 6 dB increase, while a ratio of 10:1 (ten times) corresponds to a 20 dB increase. In contrast, a ratio of 1:2 (one half) corresponds to a -6 dB decrease, whereas a ratio of 1:10 (one tenth) corresponds to a -20 dB decrease. Decibel is non-linear and operates on the logarithmic domain. The decibel class is perfectly suitable for dynamics processing (e.g. compressors and limiters and envelopes). Q provides fast decibel computations using fast math functions and lookup tables for converting to and from scalars. #include struct decibel_unit; struct decibel : _unspecified_base_type_ { using base_type = _unspecified_base_type_; using base_type::base_type; using unit_type = decibel_unit; }; // Free functions double lin_double(decibel db); constexpr float lin_float(decibel db); inline decibel approx_db(float val); decibel lin_to_db(double val); // Literals inline namespace literals { constexpr decibel operator \"\" _dB(unsigned long long int val); constexpr decibel operator \"\" _dB(long double val); } decibel is a model of Unit.

This version ought to have corrected this nonintuitive semantics, but this is a disruptive change that will alter the semantics of all existing code without warning. In order to avoid further confusion, we will mark this constructor as deleted for the time being, making it a hard error to alert users upgrading to this library version.

The lin_to_db function performs linear to decibel conversion. Example: auto db = lin_to_db(2.0); // 6 dB In addition to lin_to_db, approx_db is another free function that performs linear to decibel conversion. It is a faster, but less accurate conversion function from a linear value to decibel. lin_float and lin_double convert decibel to a linear value with float and double results, respectively.
